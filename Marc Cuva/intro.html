<p>I have been extremely passionate about technology since a very young age. Between playing video games, exploring the internet, and eventually programming, I knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up.</p><p> Throughout high school I taught my self how to program and even founded a Computer Science club to teach other interested students.</p><p>In the fall I enrolled in the College of Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota with no question about my major.  When I graduate with my Computer Science degree, I'm going to program for a company that is changing the world, whether it is Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, or a company that currently does not exist.</p>
